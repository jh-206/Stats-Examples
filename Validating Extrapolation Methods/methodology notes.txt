1. random selection w replacement of loans to 
create resample of initial gavm sample

2. For each loan selected in resample in 1,
randomly select GAVM value from 1,001 GAVM values

Repeat 2,000 times

Calculate inflation for each loan, compute average appraisal inflation

95% confidence interval constructed from distribution of 2,000 iterations



true - pred / pred = .08

true = .08*pred + pred = 1.08 pred
true / 1.08 = pred
